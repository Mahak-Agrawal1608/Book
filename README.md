ðŸŒŸ About the Book
"Finding Purpose & Dharma in the 21st Century" is a heartfelt exploration into the timeless wisdom of Dharma and how it resonates with the complexities of our modern lives. Bridging ancient philosophies with contemporary realities, this book invites readers to reflect, realign, and rediscover their true life path.

Through thoughtful insights, historical references, real-life applications, and inspirational quotes, I aim to help readers not just understand their Dharma â€” but live it meaningfully in today's fast-paced world.

ðŸ“– Key Themes
The Meaning of Dharma â€” beyond religion, as a guiding principle for life.

The Four Purusharthas â€” balancing Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha.

Karma & Dharma Connection â€” how past actions shape our journey.

Lessons from the Bhagavad Gita â€” timeless strategies for real-world challenges.

âœ¨ Why This Book?
In an age overflowing with distractions, pressures, and information, many of us feel disconnected from our core purpose. I wrote this book as a humble guide for anyone seeking clarity, inner strength, and a sense of true fulfillment â€” blending ancient knowledge with a modern, practical approach.
